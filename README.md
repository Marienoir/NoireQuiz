# NoireQuiz
Designed a quiz app using HTML, CSS and Javascript. 
This quiz app was a challenge from an online class 
I participated in.
NoireQuiz app uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript. HTML was
used for skeleton coding, CSS was used for the app styling and JavaScript
was used for setting questions from an array.
